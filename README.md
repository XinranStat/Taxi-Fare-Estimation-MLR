# **NYC Taxi Fare Estimation Project**

## Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a regression model to estimate taxi fares before a ride using data from the **New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)**. The analysis involves **data cleaning, visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and multiple linear regression** to identify key factors influencing fare amounts.  

## Key Tasks  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering and selection  
- Multiple linear regression modeling  
- Model evaluation and interpretation  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, visualization, regression analysis  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is based on **fictitious taxi trip data** provided by the **TLC**. It includes variables such as trip distance, pickup/drop-off location, time of day, and passenger count.
